Sitemap & Product CSV Fetching
To fetch products from your WordPress site using the sitemap:

Sitemap XML URL: Provide the full URL of your product's sitemap (e.g., https://example.com/sitemap-products.xml).

Batch Size: Define the number of products to fetch per batch.

Start Index: Set the starting index for fetching (e.g., use 0 for products 1–20, 20 for products 21–40, etc.).

This allows you to fetch product data in manageable chunks for processing or export.
